# UnboundedChain.lean — existence of a limit for the classical-type family

Section 5.1's actual gap (documented in `RamanujanNested.lean`) is that the
paper attributes convergence of `a_k = k`-type radicals to Section 4.1's
boundedness theorem, but that theorem needs a FIXED ceiling `A` with
`a_k ≤ A` for all `k`, which no unbounded sequence satisfies. This file closes
part of that gap for the specific linearly-growing family already central to
the paper (`a_k = N+k-2`, `IdentityChain.lean`'s Algorithm 3 coefficients,
the same shape as the classical `a_k = k` up to a shift): instead of a FIXED
ceiling, it uses a *moving* ceiling that grows in step with the coefficients
themselves.

## What's proven here

`rollUp_classicalCoeff_bounded`: for any target `N ≥ 1` and seed `T ∈ [0,N]`,
every truncation of the constant-seed-`T` radical with coefficients
`a_k = N+k-2` lies in `[0, N]` — not because the coefficients are bounded (
they aren't), but because at each recursive layer the bound `N` for the
outer family becomes exactly the bound `N+1` for the once-shifted family,
and `IdentityChain.lean`'s own identity `(N-1)(N+1)+1 = N²` makes the
induction close. Combined with `Monotone.lean` (which never needed an upper
bound on `a_k` in the first place), this gives `classicalRadical_converges`:
**the truncated radical genuinely has a finite limit `L ≤ N`** — a real
existence-of-limit result for an unbounded coefficient family, which
Section 4.1 as stated does not supply.

## What's still open: pinning down `L = N` exactly

The above gives `L ≤ N`, not `L = N`. A natural next attempt is to bound the
gap between the forward evaluation (seed `T=0`) and the "rolling" evaluation
(seed `T=N+d`, which by `IdentityChain.lean` hits `N` exactly at every finite
depth) using the same conjugate-multiplication contraction used in
`TargetRadical.lean`. Carried out here (on paper, not committed as a Lean
theorem because it does not actually work — recorded for honesty rather than
silently discarded):

Let `Δ_k` be the gap between the two seeds' values at layer `k`. The
per-layer contraction is `Δ_k ≤ (N+k-2)/(N+k-1) · Δ_{k+1}` (using only that
the rolling path equals `N+k-1` exactly and the forward path is `≥ 0`no
lower bound on the forward path is needed, unlike the failed uniform-ratio
attempt below). Telescoping from `k=1` to `k=d`:

`∏_{k=1}^{d} (N+k-2)/(N+k-1) = (N-1)/(N+d-1)`  (exact telescoping cancellation)

and the boundary gap is `Δ_{d+1} = (N+d) - 0 = N+d`. So

`Δ_1 ≤ (N+d) · (N-1)/(N+d-1) → N-1`  as `d → ∞`,

**not → 0.** The shrinking telescoped product and the growing boundary gap
almost exactly cancel, leaving a constant-order bound — this estimate is too
lossy to conclude `L = N`. (An earlier, cruder attempt — bounding each
`Δ_k`'s denominator uniformly using `V_k(T=0) ≥ c·k` — fails even worse:
numerically, `V_k` at seed `T=0` stays near `1` for `k` close to the
truncation depth `d` and only grows roughly linearly for `k` well inside the
depth, so no single constant `c` bounds `V_k/k` uniformly across `k`.) This
mirrors why Herschfeld's classical convergence criterion for infinite nested
radicals is a genuine theorem and not a two-line estimate — closing `L = N`
here needs a sharper argument than a direct tail-sensitivity bound, and is
left open rather than forced.

`T(d) ≤ N+d` gives a truncated radical bounded by `N` — combining
`rollUp_mono_seed` (monotonicity in the seed, `Monotone.lean`) with the exact
rolling identity above. This is exactly the informal reasoning of Appendix
A.1's Table 3 ("since the map `T ↦ R_1^{(d)}(T)` is monotone increasing and
`T=N+d` yields `R_1^{(d)}=N` exactly, any policy satisfying `T(d) ≤ N+d` is
guaranteed to approach `N` from below without ever exceeding it"), made
precise: the five concrete tail policies in the table (`T=0`, `T=1`,
`T=d/2`, `T=√d`, `T=d`) are all instances with `T(d) ≤ N+d` at `N=3`. -/
