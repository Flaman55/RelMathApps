# HerschfeldClosure.lean — L(N) = N, exactly

Closes (for the `a_k = N+k-2` family — and, by trivial reindexing, the
classical `a_k = k` case from Section 5.1) the remaining half of the gap
`UnboundedChain.lean` left open: that file proves the truncated radical has a
finite limit `L(N) ≤ N`; this file proves `L(N) = N` exactly.

The closing argument below improves on an earlier two-phase ("bulk vs
boundary") sketch that turned out to be unnecessary: a single GLOBAL
multiplicative growth bound
`δ(N+1) ≥ δ(N)·(N+1)/(N-1)` (valid for every `N`, not just while `δ` is
small — it only ever uses the trivial ceiling `δ(N) ≤ N-1`) telescopes to an
explicit *quadratic*-in-step lower bound, which cleanly outraces the
*linear* trivial ceiling. No arbitrary cutoff anywhere — this is the "real
boundary" Artur asked for.

## Status

No `sorry`: `limitVal`, its `Tendsto`/bounds, the functional equation
`limitVal_functional_eq`, `deficit_recursion`, `deficit_growth` (the key
global bound), `quad_step` + `deficit_quadratic_lower` (telescoping over `j`
steps), and `limitVal_eq_self` (the closing contradiction) are all written
out in full and confirmed building (`lake build`, run by Artur).

has the same limit `L(N)` as the original (via `tendsto_succ_atTop`), and
also equals (pointwise, exactly) `d ↦ √(1+(N-1)·truncRadical (classicalCoeff
(N+1)) d)`, which tends to `√(1+(N-1)·L(N+1))` by continuity of `√` and of
the affine map — equate the two limits. -/

Suppose `limitVal N < N` (i.e. `deficit N > 0`). `deficit_quadratic_lower`
gives a lower bound on `deficit (N+j)` growing like `j²`; `deficit_le_ceiling`
gives an upper bound growing only like `j`. The Archimedean property picks a
concrete `j` large enough (`exists_nat_gt`) that the quadratic lower bound
already exceeds the linear ceiling at that `j` — contradiction. -/
