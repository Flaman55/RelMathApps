# IdentityChain.lean — Appendix A.1, Algorithm 3

"Verification of the identity chain": for an integer target `N ≥ 2` and depth
`d`, define `R_{d+1} = N + d` and, for `k` from `d` down to `1`,
`R_k = √(1 + (N+k-2)·R_{k+1})`. The paper claims (by "a direct computation")
that `R_k = N + k - 1` for every `k`, in particular `R_1 = N`.

Rather than encode the backward loop as a genuinely recursive Lean function
(which would just duplicate `rollUp` with a different coefficient/seed
convention), we formalize the claim exactly the way the paper states it: the
CLOSED FORM `R_k := N + k - 1` is exhibited, and we prove it satisfies the
stated recursion at every step. This is "a direct computation shows that
R_k = N+k-1", made precise and machine-checked.

/-- **Algorithm 3, the identity chain.** The closed form `R_k = N+k-1` satisfies
the recursion `R_k = √(1 + (N+k-2)·R_{k+1})` for every `N ≥ 2` and every `k`
(the algebraic identity underneath, `(m-1)² = 1 + (m-2)·m` with `m = N+k`,
holds unconditionally in `k`; only `N ≥ 2` is needed so that `N+k-1 ≥ 0` and the
square root can be inverted). In particular (`k = 1`) this gives `R_1 = N`. -/

/-- In particular, `R_1 = N`: the identity chain closes exactly at the target,
which is the numerical phenomenon documented in Table 1 (the "Rolling
