# TargetRadical.lean — a constant-coefficient radical hitting an exact target

This formalizes the idea from the 2026-07-17 conversation: instead of trying
to prove that the classical, UNBOUNDED Ramanujan radical (`a_k = k`) converges
to a prescribed target under the forward evaluation (an open gap — see
`RamanujanNested.lean`'s "Known gap" section, since `Bounds.lean` needs a
fixed uniform ceiling `A`), build a genuinely different, structurally simple
nested radical that:

1. uses a CONSTANT coefficient `a_k = t - 1/t` (bounded — trivially satisfies
   `Bounds.lean`'s hypothesis with `A = t - 1/t`),
2. is exactly the paper's own general framework (Section 4, `a_k = f(k)`,
   here `f` constant), so it's not a foreign trick — it's the same machine,
3. converges to the target `t` EXACTLY, not merely bounded by it, and
4. does so geometrically fast, with an explicit, computable rate
   `ρ = (t - 1/t) / t = 1 - 1/t²`, strictly less than 1.

This is "a different product of equivalent strength": same target value,
same general framework, provably convergent using machinery already built
here (`Bounds.lean`), sidestepping the open question about the classical
unbounded case entirely rather than resolving it.

`rStar (8/3) = (8/3 + √(64/9+36/9))/2 = (8/3+10/3)/2 = 3` — exactly.) -/
