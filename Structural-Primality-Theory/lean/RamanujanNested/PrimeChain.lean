# PrimeChain.lean — existence of a limit for the prime-coefficient radical

The paper's Appendix A.2 example, `a_k = p_k` (the `k`-th prime), is the one
case left genuinely unformalized by `UnboundedChain.lean` /
`HerschfeldClosure.lean`: those files close the `a_k = N+k-2` family exactly,
using an algebraic self-similarity (shifting the sequence by one shifts `N`
by one) that primes simply do not have. This file does NOT attempt the exact
value — it establishes a much weaker, but still new, claim: the truncated
radical for `a_k = p_k` has SOME finite limit as depth `→ ∞`.

## Strategy

`Bounds.lean`'s fixed-ceiling argument needs `a_k ≤ A` for one constant `A`,
which fails for any unbounded sequence. But primes only grow *slowly*
(`p_k ~ k log k`), far below the doubly-exponential growth classically known
to still permit convergence (Herschfeld's original criterion for infinite
nested radicals). Rather than reprove that general criterion, this file
proves a self-contained special case sufficient for primes: a *geometric*
growth bound `a_k ≤ r^k` (any fixed `r > 1`) already gives a genuine, depth-
independent ceiling on the truncated radical (`rollUp_geomBounded`), via a
moving ceiling `A·r^i` that shrinks back to a FIXED constant `A·r^0 = A` at
the top level — no delicate limiting argument needed, unlike
`HerschfeldClosure.lean`.

Primes satisfy `p_k ≤ 4^k` (in fact much less), and that bound itself follows
from Bertrand's postulate: each prime is less than twice the previous one, so
doubling is dominated by base-4 growth with room to spare
(`nth_prime_le_four_pow`). This file uses Mathlib's own Bertrand
(`Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul`, alias `Nat.bertrand`) rather than
Artur's independently-verified `StructuralBertrand.bertrand_chebyshev`
(same statement) purely to avoid a cross-project Lean dependency; swapping
one for the other is a one-line change if the two projects are later linked.

## Status

Written in full, not yet built — this is a first attempt for `lake build` to
check, in the same spirit as every other file in this project.

/-! ## Step 1: a crude growth bound on the primes, from Bertrand's postulate -/

/-- The `n`-th prime (Mathlib's `Nat.nth Nat.Prime`, 0-indexed: `nth Prime 0 = 2`)
is at most `4^(n+1)`. Proved by induction using Bertrand's postulate: each
prime is less than twice the previous one, and `2 * 4^(n+1) ≤ 4^(n+2)` with
room to spare. -/

/-! ## Step 2: the coefficient sequence itself -/

/-- The paper's Appendix A.2 example, `a_k = p_k`: the `k`-th prime, 1-indexed
to match the paper's convention (`primeCoeff 1 = 2`, `primeCoeff 2 = 3`,
`primeCoeff 3 = 5`, ...). Index `0` is a dummy — `rollUp`/`truncRadical` never
read `a 0` — set to `0` so it doesn't interfere with the global growth bound
below. -/

/-! ## Step 3: a general moving-ceiling bound for geometrically-growing
coefficients -/

/-- **Geometric moving-ceiling boundedness.** Generalizes `Bounds.lean`'s
FIXED ceiling to coefficients that grow geometrically instead of staying
below a constant. If `b k ≤ r^(i+k)` for all `k` (the "shifted by `i`" growth
bound), `r > 1`, `A ≥ 0`, and `A` is large enough relative to `r`
(`1 ≤ A*(A - r^2)`), then `rollUp b T d ≤ A * r^i` — a bound that does NOT
grow with the truncation depth `d`, only with the starting shift `i`.
Quantifying `i` (and hence the coefficient function `b`) inside the induction
is the same device `UnboundedChain.lean` uses for the linear family; here the
moving ceiling is `A*r^i` rather than `N+1`, and — unlike that file — it
closes to a genuine fixed constant `A*r^0 = A` at the top level `i = 0`. -/

itself leaves as an open problem in v2 (see `RamanujanNested.lean`). Unlike
`HerschfeldClosure.lean`'s exact-value result for `a_k = N+k-2`, this only
establishes EXISTENCE of a finite limit, via a much cruder growth bound
(`p_k ≤ 4^k`, itself following from Bertrand's postulate). The exact value is
not pinned down here and is left open, matching the paper. -/
